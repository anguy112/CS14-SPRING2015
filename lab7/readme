TREES
Advantages: Trees are sorted. You can keep inserting as many values as wanted
since allocated memory is not fixed.

Disadvantages: Slower lookup times and slower insert times compared to hash tables.
From the plot, the lookup and insertion times for trees varies greatly.







HASH TABLES
Advantages: Fast insertion and lookup times. From the plot, the lookup and insertion times
for hash tables is very steady.

Disadvantages: Hash tables are unsorted. Allocted memory is fixed.






Something else to measure to compare trees and hash tables are how long it takes
to pop a value.
